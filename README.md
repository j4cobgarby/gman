### Have you ever wanted to read your favourite GitHub repository's README, but in _style_?

Well no, you probably haven't. But **now you can!** Just pop in your organization and repository, and before you know it you'll be
reading your README as you've never experienced it before!

### Still not convinced? Just read a few of the many positive reviews:

~~~**Bob:** This is the most pointless website I've ever seen. Why can't I just read my README on GitHu- _Wha.. is that a gun?_~~~

. . .

**Bob: Absolutely one of the most enlightening and entertaining websites certainly of the year, perhaps of all time! 10/10 stars!**

### See? Now all that's left is for you to [have a look yourself!](http://gman.jacobgarby.co.uk)
